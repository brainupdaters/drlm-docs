Backup Operations
=================

DRLM backup operations allow us to remotely create new backups of
clients, enable and disable restore points and make listings of
backups created among other things.

Run Backup
----------

This command is used to Run remote client backup from DRLM. It is
called like this::

   ~# drlm runbackup [options]

The :program:`drlm runbackup` has several options:

.. program:: `drlm runbackup`

.. option:: -c client_name, --client client_name

   Select Client to remotely run backup by name.

   Examples::

   ~# drlm runbackup -c clientHost1
   ~# drlm runbackup --client clientHost1

.. option:: -I client_id, --id client_id

   Select Client to remotely run backup by ID.

   Examples::

   ~# drlm runbackup -I 12
   ~# drlm runbackup --id 12

.. option:: -C config_name, --config config_name

   Since DRLM 2.4.0 it is possible to have multiple configurations for each Client. The configurations must be in **/etc/drlm/clients/client_name.cfg.d/** path and with **.cfg** extension (ex.: home_backup.cfg). 
   With -C parameter is possible to select witch client backup configuration will be used. If is not especified, default configuration **/etc/drlm/clients/client_name.cfg** will be used 

   Examples::

   ~# drlm runbackup -c clientHost1 -C home_backup
   ~# drlm runbackup --id 12 --config home_backup

Help option:

.. option:: -h, --help

   Show drlm runbackup help.

   Examples::

   ~# drlm runbackup -h
   ~# drlm runbackup --help

Delete Backup
-------------

This command is used to delete backups from DRLM database. It is
called like this::

   ~# drlm delbackup [options]

.. warning::

   To remove a backup, it must be disabled.

.. program:: `drlm delbackup`

.. option:: -c client_name, --client client_name

   Select Client to delete the backups.

.. option:: -I backup_id, --id backup_id

   Select Backup to delete by ID.

.. option:: -A, --all

   Delete All backup.

   Examples::

List Backups
------------

This command is used to list the backups that we have stored on the
server. It is called like this::

   ~# drlm listbackup [options]

   List all backups. This option is set by default if any option is specified.

   Examples::

   ~# drlm listbackup
   ~# drlm listbackup -A
   ~# drlm listbackup --all

.. option:: -p, --pretty

   Marks those backups that might have failed with colors. By default, it colors in red the backups that are less than 200MB or that took less than 60 seconds to complete. Also, it colors in yellow the backups that are less than 800MB or that took less than 120 seconds. These values can be changed in the configuration with the following configurations:

   ::

      BACKUP_SIZE_STATUS_FAILED="200"

      BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_FAILED="60"
      BACKUP_TIME_STATUS_WARNING="120"

   .. note:: This option is enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting `DEF_PRETTY=false` in `/etc/drlm/local.conf`.

You can also enable or disable the schedule function (by default it is enabled). You can set backup operations to run on a specified date and time by running:
