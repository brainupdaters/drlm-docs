DRLM Installation
=================

The pourpose of this manual is explain, step by step, the installation and configuration of DRLM. At the end of this guide you should have a fully functional DRLM server.

Debian 8/9/10 & Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04 LTS
--------------------------------------------

.. note::
   On the following steps, is assumed you have a minimal installation of Debian 8/9 or Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 LTS.

Install requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	~# apt update
	~# apt upgrade
	~# apt install openssh-client openssl gawk nfs-kernel-server rpcbind isc-dhcp-server tftpd-hpa qemu-utils sqlite3 lsb-release bash-completion


Get DRLM
~~~~~~~~

You can obtain the DRLM package building it from the source code

**Build DEB package from Source**

::

	~# apt install git build-essential debhelper golang
	~$ git clone https://github.com/brainupdaters/drlm
	~$ cd drlm
	~$ make deb
	~$ cd ..


Install DRLM package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:program:`The DEB package can be installed as follows (on Debian, Ubuntu)`

Execute the next command:
::

	~# dpkg -i drlm_2.3.1_all.deb


DRLM Components Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers configuration of:

* GRUB
* TFTP Service


Configuring loop limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default configuration allows up to eight active loop devices. If more than eight file-based guests or loop devices are needed the number of loop devices configured can be adjusted adding the parameter *max_loop=1024* in the **/etc/default/grub** file as follows::

	...

	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="quiet max_loop=1024" ##UPDATE THIS LINE

	...

::

	~# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


TFTP
~~~~
You have to update the destination folder in the /etc/default/tftpd-hpa cofiguration file as follows

::

	# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
	TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
	TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/drlm/store"
	TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
	TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"

DHCP
~~~~
You have to update the interfaces where the DHCP server is going to listen

::

      # /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
      INTERFACESv4="<interface-name>"


Restart & check services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  ~# systemctl restart tftpd-hpa.service
  ~# systemctl status tftpd-hpa.service

  ~# systemctl restart rpcbind.service
  ~# systemctl status rpcbind.service


.. note::
 DHCP and NFS servers are not running because there is no config yet! no worries they will be reloaded automatically after first DRLM client will be added.


Debian 7 & Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
---------------------------

.. note::
   On the following steps, is assumed you have a minimal installation of Debian 7 or Ubuntu 14.04.

Install requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	~# apt-get update
	~# apt-get upgrade
	~# apt-get install openssh-client openssl wget gzip tar gawk sed grep coreutils util-linux nfs-kernel-server rpcbind isc-dhcp-server tftpd-hpa qemu-utils sqlite3 lsb-release bash-completion

::

	# /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
	TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
	TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/drlm/store"
	TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
	TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"


Restart & check services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  ~# service tfrpd-hpa restart
  ~# service tftpd-hpa status
  in.tftpd is running.
  ~# service rpcbind restart
  ~# service rpcbind status
  rpcbind is running.


.. note::

 	 DHCP and NFS servers are not running because there is no config yet! no worries they will be reloaded automatically after first DRLM client will be added.


CentOS 7/8 & RHEL 7/8
---------------------

.. note::
   On the following steps, is assumed you have a minimal installation of CentOS or RHEL 7.

.. warning:: SELinux has been disabled

::

  ~$ cat /etc/sysconfig/selinux

  # This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
  # SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
  #     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
  #     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
  #     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
  SELINUX=disabled
  # SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
  #     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
  #     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
  SELINUXTYPE=targeted

::

  ~# setenforce 0


.. warning:: Firewall has been disabled

      Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1.service.

.. note::

   It is not a requirement to disable SELinux and Firewall, but to work with DRLM Server must be properly configured. We have disabled this features for easier installation.

If you don't want to disable Firewalld, you will need to accept connections on the following ports:
 - `53/tcp`
 - `53/udp`
 - `69/tcp`
 - `69/udp`
 - `443/tcp`
